# CS210-CornerGrocer
Project Summary

For this course, I selected my Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program to include in my portfolio. This project solved the problem of analyzing grocery purchase data to determine how frequently items were bought throughout the day. The program reads an input file, counts item occurrences, and allows users to interact with the data through a menu system. It outputs individual item frequencies, a complete list of all frequencies, and a text-based histogram, while also creating a backup file for data persistence.

What I Did Well

I did particularly well in designing the program using object-oriented programming principles. By creating a dedicated GroceryTracker class, I encapsulated the logic for file handling, item counting, and report generation. This separation of responsibilities made the program easier to understand and maintain.

Areas for Enhancement

One area I could enhance is input validation and user interaction. Currently, the program handles invalid menu options and missing files, but future improvements could include allowing multi-word item names and improving error messages. These enhancements would make the program more robust and user-friendly, which is critical for secure and efficient software.

Challenges and How I Overcame Them

The most challenging part of the project was implementing the map-based frequency counter correctly and ensuring case-insensitive handling of items while preserving original display formatting. I overcame this by breaking the problem into smaller pieces, consulting C++ documentation, and testing my code step by step. This strengthened my ability to debug and reinforced the importance of using standard library containers.

Transferable Skills

The skills I developed in this project are highly transferable. I improved my ability to design modular, object-oriented systems, use C++ STL containers, and handle file input/output. These are fundamental skills that apply to larger-scale software development, database applications, and even projects in other programming languages.

Code Maintainability

I made the program maintainable and readable by using clear naming conventions, inline comments, and consistent formatting. The class-based design ensures that future developers could easily extend functionality, such as adding new output formats or supporting additional input types, without rewriting the entire program.
